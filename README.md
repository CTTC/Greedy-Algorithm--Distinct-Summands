# Greedy-Algorithm--Distinct-Summands
This is a simple application where greedy algorithm makes the code run very efficiently. Use greedy algorithm to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. The code is efficient to very large number.
Several examples are shown below. 
<p>
``` 8 = 1 + 2 + 5 ```
<p>
``` 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ```
<p>
``` 23 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 8 ```
